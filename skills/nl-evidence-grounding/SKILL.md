description: "Fact-check a Dutch policy claim or numeric assertion against the official record — triangulating CBS statistics, Rijksfinanciën budget data (phase-labelled OWB/O1/O2/JV), kamerstukken framing, and Rechtspraak rulings — into a source-cited Evidence Dossier with a falsifiable restatement, a source-independence table, a fixed-vocabulary triangulation verdict, a causation audit, and a debate-connect trace (toezegging → budget trajectory → CBS realisation → parliamentary framing). Use this skill whenever the user asks "is this claim true", wants to fact-check a minister's statement or a stated figure, wants to ground a numeric claim in the official record, asks "what does CBS say about X", wants to verify the minister's numbers, or wants a beleidsdoorlichting-style evidence check on a specific assertion. Do NOT use for: tracking a pledge's delivery status over time or a said-vs-done ledger across a frozen, bounded commitment corpus (→ `nl-accountability`); adversarial angle-hunting or contradiction-mining across an entire topic for roundtable angles (→ `nl-tensions`); a comprehensive topic or policy landscape survey (→ `nl-policy-legislative-landscape`). This skill grounds one bounded claim, or a small batch of 1-5 claims — it is a targeted fact-check, not a monitoring stream."

# Evidence grounding (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `nl-gov-data` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `nl-gov-data` MCP with `path="skills/nl-evidence-grounding/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/nl-evidence-grounding"` (and `path="skills/nl-evidence-grounding/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/nl-evidence-grounding/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `nl-gov-data` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.

## If the `nl-gov-data` MCP is slow to respond

This server scales to zero to save cost, so the first call may take ~10–30s to cold-start. If `fs_read` or a tool errors with unavailable/timeout:

1. Tell the user the server is starting, then retry the same `fs_read` call — the call itself wakes the container.
2. Retry with a short backoff up to ~3 times.
3. Only if it is still unreachable after retries, STOP and report. Never downgrade to a local or base skill just to "get something out".
