# Company Data Schema: Messaging Library

Schema reference for the `messaging/` content library directory. This library stores reusable messaging assets that the skill produces and that downstream comms skills (talking-points, media-pitch, campaign-narrative, etc.) can consume.

## Directory Structure

> **Operator environment only.** The tree below shows the canonical layout inside `client-data/clients/<company-name>/`. This structure is NOT present in deployed plugins — plugins ship a redacted `companies/{client_slug}/company_context.json` overlay (see "Deployed plugin layout" below). The deployed skill reads `company_context.json` exclusively.

```
client-data/clients/<company-name>/           ← OPERATOR ONLY — not in deployed plugins
├── profile.json              # Full company identity (source of truth; operator-side only)
├── people.json               # Full people roster (source of truth; operator-side only)
├── company_context.json      # Redacted export — what deployed plugins read
├── brand/                    # Visual identity (shared — all branded skills)
│   └── charter.json
├── proposals/                # Proposal content library (proposal skill)
│   ├── case-studies.json
│   ├── testimonials.json
│   └── ...
└── messaging/                # Messaging content library (this skill)
    ├── pillars.json          # Reusable messaging pillars with proof attachments
    ├── proof-points.json     # Evidence library organized by type and topic
    ├── audiences.json        # Audience profiles with adaptation parameters
    └── narratives.json       # Core narratives, positioning, elevator pitches
```

### Deployed plugin layout

In a deployed plugin, the skill reads from the plugin overlay only:

```
companies/{client_slug}/
└── company_context.json      # Redacted company data — the ONLY company data source in deployed plugins
    # Structure:
    # { "company": { name, legalName, displayName, description, tagline, website,
    #                industry, services[], industries[], positioning, values[], stats,
    #                publicContact:{...} },
    #   "credentials": [...] or { certifications, awards, memberships },
    #   "pricing": { publicModels:[...] },
    #   "legal": { publicTerms:... },
    #   "people": [{ id, name, title, publicRole, publicBio, quoteStyle }],
    #   "redactions": [...] }
    # NOTE: no banking/registration/VAT/billing/personal-contact fields.
```

## pillars.json

Array of messaging pillars with their supporting statements and proof point references.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "pillar-001",
    "headline": "Short headline (3-7 words)",
    "shortStatement": "Single sentence, under 20 words — derivative-ready for battlecards, social, cheat sheets",
    "statement": "1-2 sentence supporting statement expanding the headline",
    "messageLengths": {
      "headline": "Under 10 words",
      "short": "1 sentence",
      "full": "2-3 sentences"
    },
    "proofPointIds": ["proof-001", "proof-002", "proof-003"],
    "scope": "brand",
    "tags": ["digital-transformation", "enterprise"],
    "created": "2026-03-21",
    "lastReviewed": "2026-03-21"
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier (e.g., `"pillar-001"`) |
| `headline` | string | yes | Short pillar headline (3-7 words) |
| `shortStatement` | string | yes | Single sentence under 20 words — derivative-ready for battlecards, social posts, cheat sheets |
| `statement` | string | yes | Supporting statement (1-2 sentences) |
| `messageLengths` | object | no | Pre-written message variants: `headline` (under 10 words), `short` (1 sentence), `full` (2-3 sentences) |
| `proofPointIds` | string[] | yes | References to `proof-points.json` entries |
| `scope` | string | yes | `"brand"`, `"product"`, `"campaign"`, or `"initiative"` |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Topic tags for filtering and matching |
| `created` | string | no | ISO date when the pillar was created |
| `lastReviewed` | string | no | ISO date when last reviewed for accuracy |

**`scope` values:**
- `"brand"` — Applies across the entire organization
- `"product"` — Specific to a product or service line
- `"campaign"` — Created for a specific campaign (may be time-limited)
- `"initiative"` — Tied to a strategic initiative

---

## proof-points.json

Array of evidence items, each categorized by type and linked to the pillars they support.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "proof-001",
    "type": "quantitative",
    "claim": "94% reduction in customer onboarding time",
    "source": "NordBank AG engagement, 2024",
    "verified": true,
    "tier": 1,
    "tags": ["digital-transformation", "financial-services", "efficiency"],
    "lastVerified": "2026-01-15"
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier (e.g., `"proof-001"`) |
| `type` | string | yes | One of: `"quantitative"`, `"customer"`, `"third-party"`, `"capability"`, `"credibility"`, `"narrative"` |
| `claim` | string | yes | The proof point statement |
| `source` | string | yes | Where this evidence comes from |
| `source` | string | yes | Human-readable origin (e.g., "NordBank AG engagement, 2024") |
| `verified` | boolean | no | Whether this has been fact-checked |
| `tier` | number | no | Evidence strength: 1 (strongest) to 5 (weakest) — see proof-taxonomy.md |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Topic tags for filtering |
| `lastVerified` | string | no | ISO date when last fact-checked |

Proof points are self-contained within the messaging library. When curating evidence that also appears elsewhere in the company data (e.g., a case study used in proposals), copy the relevant claim and source into `proof-points.json` rather than cross-referencing other skills' files.

## Cross-Reference Map

How files within the messaging library connect to each other and to `company_context.json`:

```
company_context.json (read-only — deployed company data source)
  └── company.services[].id ──────→ pillars.json → tags (match by service area)
  └── credentials.awards ─────────→ proof-points.json (type: "third-party")
  └── credentials.certifications ─→ proof-points.json (type: "third-party")
  └── people[] ───────────────────→ proof-points.json (type: "customer" — quotes, bios)

messaging/pillars.json
  └── [].proofPointIds ───────────→ messaging/proof-points.json → [].id

messaging/audiences.json
  └── [].pillarPriority ──────────→ messaging/pillars.json → [].id
  └── [].topObjection.proofId ────→ messaging/proof-points.json → [].id
```

The messaging library is self-contained — it does not read from or depend on other skills' data directories (`proposals/`, `press-releases/`, etc.). When evidence from those sources is relevant, the user should curate it into `messaging/proof-points.json` during framework creation.
