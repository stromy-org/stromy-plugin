description: "Product guide for researching Dutch government, policy, and legislation — what to ask for, which research skill fits, how findings hand off to your branded documents, and where finished work lands. Use whenever someone asks \"how do I research Dutch government/policy/legislation\", \"how do I turn research into a report/briefing\", \"which research skill do I need\", or any orientation question specifically about Dutch public-affairs research. For first-time install, switching on connectors, or a general \"how do I get started\", the `getting-started` skill is the entry point. Routes to the right research skill and hands off to the document tools; does not itself produce documents."

# NL Guide — getting started with Dutch government research (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `nl-gov-data` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `nl-gov-data` MCP with `path="skills/nl-guide/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/nl-guide"` (and `path="skills/nl-guide/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/nl-guide/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `nl-gov-data` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
