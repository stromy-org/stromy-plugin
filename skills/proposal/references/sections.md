# Standard Proposal Sections — Templates & Writing Guidance

This reference provides detailed guidance for each section of a consulting proposal. Use it during Step 2 (Section Drafting) of the proposal workflow.

## Section Catalog

### 1. Cover Page

**Purpose**: First impression — establishes professionalism and sets the tone.
**Typical length**: 1 page

**Key elements:**
- Client organization name (prominently placed)
- Project title / proposal title
- Date of submission
- Firm name and logo
- Document classification (e.g., "Confidential", "Draft")
- Version number (if applicable)

**Writing guidance:**
- The project title should be specific and outcome-oriented, not generic
- Good: "Digital Transformation Roadmap for Patient Intake Operations"
- Bad: "Consulting Proposal" or "Project Proposal"

**Common mistakes:**
- Wrong client name or misspelling
- Outdated date
- Missing confidentiality marking
- Generic title that doesn't reflect the engagement

---

### 2. Table of Contents

**Purpose**: Navigation — lets readers jump to sections of interest.
**Typical length**: 1 page

**Key elements:**
- Auto-generated from heading styles (never manually typed)
- Section numbers and page numbers
- 2-3 levels of depth (H1 and H2, optionally H3)

**Writing guidance:**
- Generate via Word's built-in TOC field using heading styles
- In docx-js, use `TableOfContents` component with appropriate heading levels

**Common mistakes:**
- Manually typed TOC that falls out of sync
- Too many levels of depth (cluttered)
- Missing page numbers

---

### 3. Executive Summary

**Purpose**: The pitch — a standalone summary that enables a decision.
**Typical length**: 1-2 pages

**Key elements:**
- Client situation and need (1-2 sentences)
- Proposed solution at the highest level
- Key differentiators (2-3 bullets: why this firm, team, approach)
- Strongest proof points (metrics, case studies, credentials)
- Investment summary (cost and timeline at a glance)
- Call to action

**Writing guidance:**
- **Write this section LAST** — after all other sections are finalized
- An executive should be able to read only this section and make an informed decision
- Lead with the client's problem, not your firm's capabilities
- Every differentiator needs a proof point
- Keep it scannable: short paragraphs, bullets for key points

**Common mistakes:**
- Writing it first (before scope is finalized)
- Making it about the firm instead of the client's needs
- Vague differentiators without evidence
- Too long (more than 2 pages loses its purpose)
- Missing the investment/timeline summary

#### Win Theme Integration

Thread 3-5 win themes from `differentiators.json` throughout the proposal:
- **Executive Summary**: State each theme with its strongest proof point
- **Approach**: Show how the methodology delivers on each theme
- **Team**: Highlight how personnel embody each theme
- **Experience**: Select case studies that prove each theme

Win themes should be client-centric (framed as client benefit, not firm capability). For example, "Speed to Value" is stronger than "Fast delivery methodology."

### 4. Client Context

**Purpose**: Demonstrates understanding — shows you've listened and done your homework.
**Typical length**: 1-2 pages

**Key elements:**
- Client's current situation and business context
- Challenges or pain points driving this engagement
- Strategic goals or desired outcomes
- Relevant industry trends or market pressures
- Any constraints mentioned in the brief/RFP

**Writing guidance:**
- Restate the client's situation in your own words (proves comprehension)
- Reference specific details from the brief/RFP
- Connect their challenges to broader trends (shows expertise)
- Avoid assumptions — stick to what was stated or is publicly known

**Common mistakes:**
- Copying the RFP verbatim (shows no added value)
- Making assumptions about internal politics or strategy
- Being too generic (could apply to any client)
- Missing key challenges mentioned in the brief

---

### 5. Objectives

**Purpose**: Alignment — explicitly defines what success looks like.
**Typical length**: 0.5-1 page

**Key elements:**
- Clear, specific objectives (not vague aspirations)
- Measurable where possible (KPIs, targets, thresholds)
- Timebound where applicable
- Mapped to client's stated goals

**Writing guidance:**
- Use the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Number each objective for easy reference in later sections
- Each objective should connect to a deliverable and a section of the approach
- Distinguish between primary objectives and secondary/stretch goals

**Common mistakes:**
- Vague objectives ("improve efficiency") without metrics
- Objectives that don't align with the client's stated needs
- Too many objectives (dilutes focus — aim for 3-5 primary)
- No connection to deliverables or timeline

---

### 6. Approach & Methodology

**Purpose**: The "how" — explains how you'll achieve the objectives.
**Typical length**: 3-6 pages

**Key elements:**
- Overall approach philosophy (why this method)
- Phases or workstreams with clear descriptions
- Key activities within each phase
- Frameworks, tools, and techniques to be used
- Client involvement and collaboration model
- Decision points and governance

**Writing guidance:**
- Lead with the *why* — explain the rationale for your approach before the details
- Use a phased structure (Discovery → Analysis → Design → Implementation → Transition)
- Show how each phase connects to objectives
- Be specific about methods without being overly technical
- Highlight what makes your approach different from a generic one
- Include visual aids: phase diagrams, process flows. When the methodology has 3+ phases, consider generating a process flow diagram using the `diagram` skill. Timeline diagrams suit the "Work Plan" section. Org charts suit the "Team" section.

**Common mistakes:**
- Too generic ("we will assess, design, and implement")
- No connection between approach and stated objectives
- Missing the client's role (collaboration expectations)
- Overly academic methodology descriptions
- No decision gates or checkpoints

---

### 7. Work Plan & Timeline

**Purpose**: The schedule — shows realistic planning and milestones.
**Typical length**: 1-2 pages

**Key elements:**
- Phase durations with start/end dates or week numbers
- Key milestones and decision points
- Dependencies between phases
- Client review/approval points
- Gantt chart or timeline table

**Writing guidance:**
- Use a table or Gantt-style visual (not just prose)
- Include buffer time for client reviews and approvals
- Mark critical path items
- Show dependencies explicitly
- Align milestones with deliverables from Section 8

**Common mistakes:**
- Unrealistic timelines (no buffer for reviews)
- Milestones not aligned with deliverables
- Missing dependencies
- No client involvement milestones
- Pure text without a visual timeline

---

### 8. Deliverables

**Purpose**: What the client receives — tangible outputs.
**Typical length**: 1-2 pages

**Key elements:**
- Numbered list of all deliverables
- Brief description of each deliverable's content and format
- Delivery timing (linked to timeline)
- Acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like)

**Writing guidance:**
- Be specific: "48-page Digital Transformation Roadmap (PDF)" not "a report"
- Each deliverable should trace to one or more objectives
- Include format (document, presentation, workshop, dashboard)
- State what's included and what's not

**Common mistakes:**
- Vague deliverable descriptions
- No connection to objectives or timeline
- Missing format specifications
- Deliverables that don't match the approach phases

---

### 9. Team & Qualifications

**Purpose**: Who delivers — builds confidence in the team.
**Typical length**: 2-3 pages

**Key elements:**
- Project leadership (engagement lead, project manager)
- Key team members with roles and relevant experience
- Organizational chart or team structure
- Relevant credentials and certifications
- Availability commitment (% allocation)

**Writing guidance:**
- Lead with why each person is the right fit for this engagement
- Highlight experience relevant to this specific client/industry
- Include brief credentials but don't pad with irrelevant qualifications
- Show the team structure and reporting lines
- Full CVs/resumes go in appendices, not here

**Common mistakes:**
- Generic bios not tailored to this engagement
- Padding with irrelevant credentials
- No clear team structure or roles
- Missing availability/allocation information
- Bait-and-switch risk (proposing senior people who won't actually work on it)

---

### 10. Relevant Experience

**Purpose**: Proof — demonstrates capability through past performance.
**Typical length**: 2-4 pages

**Key elements:**
- 3-5 relevant case studies or project summaries
- For each: client (or industry descriptor), challenge, approach, outcome, metrics
- Relevance connection: why this experience matters for this engagement
- Client references (if permitted)

**Writing guidance:**
- Select case studies by relevance, not impressiveness
- Lead with the outcome/metric, then explain how you got there
- Draw explicit parallels to the current engagement
- Use a consistent format for each case study (Challenge → Approach → Result)
- Include quantifiable outcomes where possible

**Common mistakes:**
- Case studies that don't relate to the current engagement
- No quantifiable outcomes
- Too many case studies (dilutes impact — 3-5 is ideal)
- Missing the "so what" connection to the client's needs

---

### 11. Pricing & Investment

**Purpose**: The ask — transparent fee structure.
**Typical length**: 1-3 pages

**Key elements:**
- Fee structure (fixed price, T&M, retainer, milestone-based)
- Total investment amount
- Breakdown by phase, workstream, or deliverable
- What's included (travel, materials, licenses)
- What's excluded (explicitly state)
- Payment schedule and terms
- Optional/add-on pricing (if applicable)

**Writing guidance:**
- Frame as "investment" with expected return, not just "cost"
- Be transparent — hidden costs erode trust
- Align pricing breakdown with the phases/deliverables described earlier
- Include assumptions that affect pricing (team size, duration, scope)
- Offer options if appropriate (e.g., basic vs. enhanced scope)

**Common mistakes:**
- Pricing that doesn't align with scope
- Hidden costs or vague "additional fees may apply"
- No breakdown (just a lump sum with no explanation)
- Missing payment terms
- Assumptions not stated (scope creep risk)

#### Tiered Pricing (Recommended for Consultant/Advisory Proposals)

Present 2-3 engagement options using Good/Better/Best framing:
- **Option A (Core)**: Essential scope, lowest investment
- **Option B (Recommended)**: Full scope with key additions
- **Option C (Premium)**: Comprehensive scope with strategic extras

Psychology: The middle option gets chosen most often (compromise effect). Present the highest option first to anchor price expectations. Frame as "investment" not "cost" — include expected ROI where possible.

See [archetypes.md](archetypes.md) for full tiered pricing guidance under the Consultant archetype.

### 12. Risk Management

**Purpose**: Confidence — shows foresight and preparedness.
**Typical length**: 1-2 pages

**Key elements:**
- Identified risks (project, technical, organizational)
- Likelihood and impact assessment
- Mitigation strategies for each risk
- Assumptions that could affect the engagement
- Escalation procedures

**Writing guidance:**
- Be honest but constructive — acknowledge risks while showing preparedness
- Use a risk matrix table (Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation)
- Include both delivery risks and adoption/change management risks
- State assumptions explicitly (these are often the source of disputes)

**Common mistakes:**
- Ignoring risks (looks naive)
- Being too negative (scares the client)
- Generic risks not specific to this engagement
- No mitigation strategies (just a worry list)

---

### 13. Terms & Conditions

**Purpose**: Legal framework for the engagement.
**Typical length**: 1-3 pages

**Key elements:**
- Engagement scope and boundaries
- Intellectual property ownership
- Confidentiality provisions
- Liability limitations
- Termination provisions
- Change management / scope change process
- Governing law

**Writing guidance:**
- Use clear, plain language where possible
- Reference master service agreements if one exists
- Highlight key terms the client needs to be aware of
- This section often comes from legal boilerplate — customize for the engagement

**Common mistakes:**
- Overly aggressive IP or liability terms
- Missing scope change process (leads to disputes)
- Terms that conflict with the client's standard procurement language
- Legal jargon that obscures important provisions

---

### 14. Appendices

**Purpose**: Supporting detail that doesn't belong in the main body.
**Typical length**: Variable

**Common appendix items:**
- Detailed team resumes/CVs
- Detailed methodology descriptions
- Sample deliverable outlines
- Relevant certifications and awards
- Glossary of terms
- Detailed pricing breakdown
- Technical specifications

**Writing guidance:**
- Only include appendices referenced in the main body
- Label each appendix clearly (Appendix A, B, C...)
- Ensure all cross-references from the body are correct

---

### 15. Next Steps

**Purpose**: Call to action — momentum toward engagement.
**Typical length**: 0.5-1 page

**Key elements:**
- Specific next action (e.g., "Schedule a 30-minute call to discuss")
- Contact information for the proposal lead
- Proposal validity period
- Key dates or deadlines
- What the client needs to do to proceed

**Writing guidance:**
- Be specific and action-oriented
- Reduce friction: provide exact contact details and suggest specific dates
- Create urgency if appropriate (validity period, resource availability)
- Keep it short and direct

**Common mistakes:**
- Vague call to action ("let us know if interested")
- Missing contact information
- No validity period (proposal sits indefinitely)
- Overly pushy tone

|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Cover Page | Keep — 1 page |
| Table of Contents | Omit |
| Executive Summary | Expand slightly — this becomes the core of the brief |
| Client Context | Merge into Executive Summary (1-2 sentences) |
| Objectives | Bullet list within Executive Summary |
| Approach & Methodology | Condense to 1 paragraph + phase summary table |
| Work Plan & Timeline | Condense to single timeline graphic or 1 table |
| Deliverables | Bullet list (name + one-line description) |
| Team & Qualifications | Key personnel only (name, role, one-line credential) |
| Relevant Experience | 1-2 strongest case studies (3-4 sentences each) |
| Pricing & Investment | Summary table (total + phase breakdown) |
| Risk Management | Omit (mention key assumptions inline) |
| Terms & Conditions | Omit (reference full proposal or MSA) |
| Appendices | Omit |
| Next Steps | Keep — 2-3 sentences |

**Target**: 2-4 pages including cover. Every sentence must earn its place.
